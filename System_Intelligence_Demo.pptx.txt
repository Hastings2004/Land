Slide 1: Demonstrating System Intelligence
- Atsogo Estate Agency Real Estate Management System
- Automated Plot Status Management
- No Manual Status Changes by Admins

Slide 2: What Makes the System Intelligent?
- Plot status is managed automatically by the system
- Admins cannot set or override status manually
- Status changes based on real-world events (reservation, payment, expiry)

Slide 3: Automatic Status Change Scenarios
- Reservation: Status changes to 'reserved' automatically
- Payment: Status changes to 'sold' automatically
- Expiry: Status reverts to 'available' if not paid in time
- Cancellation: Status returns to 'available' if reservation is cancelled

Slide 4: Admin Experience
- No 'Status' dropdown in plot edit form
- Backend ignores any manual status update attempts
- Admins focus on content, not status management

Slide 5: Customer Experience
- Customers see real-time status updates
- Cannot reserve or buy already sold/reserved plots
- Receive notifications for reservation expiry, payment deadlines, and status changes

Slide 6: Behind the Scenes (Automation)
- Scheduled tasks handle reservation expiry
- Payment triggers status updates and cancels other reservations
- All logic handled by the system, not by users

Slide 7: Demonstration Steps
- Reserve a plot as a customer: status becomes 'reserved'
- Let reservation expire: status returns to 'available'
- Make payment: status becomes 'sold', others cancelled
- Attempt manual status change: system ignores it

Slide 8: Key Benefits
- Reduces human error
- Ensures fairness and transparency
- Saves admin time
- Demonstrates true system intelligence
